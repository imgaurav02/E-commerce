					  			NO Of Slides

1. There are 4 items in one slides

2. If we have n items we will have n//4+1 slides if n is not divisble by 4

3. But if n is divisible by 4, we have n//4 slides

4. so formula for no of slides will be

5. n//4+ceil(n/4-n//4) where ceil is least integer function


								Python Logic 

1. We will display the first item by default and give it the active tag 

2. The next items will be fetched using for loop

3. we will fetch all the details from the database and will show them in the homepage.

4. Later we do category wise.
